# Dobugman: AI-Powered Typo & Logic Bug Detector for Code

Dobugman is an experimental AI tool that helps developers detect **typos** and **logical errors** in their code — even if the syntax is perfectly valid. It's like having a second pair of eyes, trained to catch mistakes that compilers and linters usually miss.

## 🧠 What It Does

- ✅ Detects **spelling or typo mistakes** in variable, function, and class names.
- 🔍 Analyzes code for **logical inconsistencies**, even when there's no syntax error.
- 🦾 Uses Artificial Intelligence (LLMs) to understand the *intent* of the code.
- 👨‍💻 Supports multiple programming languages (Python first, others coming soon).
- 🛠️ Ideal for debugging student code, solo projects, or even production scripts.
