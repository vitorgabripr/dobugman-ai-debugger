# Dobugman: AI-Powered Typo & Logic Bug Detector for Code

Dobugman is an experimental AI tool that helps developers catch **typos** and **logic errors** in source code — even when there are no syntax errors. It analyzes the code using natural language understanding to detect mistakes that are often overlooked by compilers and traditional linters.

---

## 💡 Why Dobugman?

Many bugs hide in plain sight:

- A wrong variable name that *looks* similar to the correct one.
- A loop that *runs* fine but does the wrong thing.
- A condition that never triggers due to a logic error.

Dobugman uses AI to **understand your code** and what it’s trying to do, helping you debug faster and smarter.
